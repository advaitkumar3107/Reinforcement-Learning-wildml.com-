# Reinforcement-Learningv- wildml.com
Contains a few implementations of RL algorithms based on the code given by denny britz on [wildml.com](http://www.wildml.com/2016/10/learning-reinforcement-learning/) which itself is based on the [lectures by David Silver](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZBiG_XpjnPrSNw-1XQaM_gB) and [Richard Sutton’s & Andrew Barto’s Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition) book](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf).
